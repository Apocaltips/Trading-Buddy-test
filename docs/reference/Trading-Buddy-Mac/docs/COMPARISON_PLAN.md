# Comparison Plan

## Baseline
- Use the 10‑hour Tradegate paper run on Mac.

## New Run
- 2‑hour merged system test (prefer Windows PC if running in parallel).

## Metrics
- Trades/hour
- Net PnL/hour
- Win rate
- Fee drag %
- Max drawdown

## Notes
- 2‑hour test is a smoke test; not statistically comparable to 10‑hour run.
- For real performance comparison, run merged system for ≥10 hours later.
