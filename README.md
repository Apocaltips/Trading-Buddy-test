# Trading Buddy - Merge Workspace

This repo is the working merge workspace for Tradegate x Trading Buddy.

## Docs
- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/BEADS.md`
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`
- `docs/SIGNAL_SCHEMA.md`
- `docs/TEST_PLAN.md`
- `docs/RUNBOOK.md`
- `docs/COMPARISON_PLAN.md`
- `docs/RISKS.md`
- `docs/GETTING_STARTED_WINDOWS.md`
- `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md`

## Golden Rules
1) Do not modify live Tradegate while the 10-hour Mac run is active.
2) Build and test in this Windows workspace.
3) Dry-run only until results are stable.

## Quick Start
```powershell
